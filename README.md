# android-dive-color-corrector

Due sea water's absorption of red light, photos taken underwater while scuba diving will appear more blue/green than they actually are.

Based on nikolajbech's [underwater image color correction algorithm](https://github.com/nikolajbech/underwater-image-color-correction), this app will adjust an underwater photograph to have correct levels of red coloring and appear more natural regardless of the depth the photo was taken at.
