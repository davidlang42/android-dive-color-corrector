# Privacy Policy

The Dive Color Corrector Android app operates by correcting the color of underwater photos on your device. It does not send or receive any data to an external server or service.

A full description of how the data you enter into Dive Color Corrector is stored is provided below.

## Photo picker

When you click "Choose a photo to color corrector", the Android operating system runs the photo picker screen, and only the photo you choose (and its file name) is provided to the Dive Color Corrector app, not all of your photos.

## Share photo

Similarly, if you choose to "share" a photo from another app to Dive Color Corrector, only the photo you have shared is accessible to the Dive Color Corrector app.

## Photo processing

As all photo processing happens on your device, your photo data is never sent anywhere and exists in memory only while the Dive Color Corrector app is running. 

## Saving the photo

When you click "Save a copy", the color corrected photo is stored back to your device under the "Pictures\Dive Color Corrector" folder, this may be accessible to anyone who uses your device.

## Further questions

Any further questions about Dive Color Corrector's privacy policy, or how Dive Color Corrector handles your data, can be emailed to [playstore@davidlang.dev](playstore@davidlang.dev).
